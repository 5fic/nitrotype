You might find fresh meat or vegetables that are about to go out of date but if you're cooking them soon that's no problem. Check the receipt for errors. Plan a shopping day and avoid unnecessary trips. Keep your recipes simple and shop happy. Angry shoppers tend to impulse buy. Shop early and avoid the frantic crowds. Some consider grocery shopping good therapy while anticipating those delicious and healthy meals for themselves and family.
