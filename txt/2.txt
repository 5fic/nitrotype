Prehistoric traders of the Delaware tribes made camp on the bank of what would someday be called the Allegheny River. Hundreds of years later settlers cut forests and built settlements near where three large rivers meet. A century after, more immigrants arrived, invented a middle class and rose to power in the city. Archaeological evidence of each group is still there, buried under centuries of city development. Archaeologists said it is now easier to link items with the people who owned them long ago due to modern research methods.
